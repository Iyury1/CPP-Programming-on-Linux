In this example, it will discuss how to use Crypto++ library to perform AES Encryption and Decryption.
In previous OpenSSL serious videos, we made one video that demonstrated how to use OpenSSL to execute AES encryption and 
Decryption, you can compare examples of both video and have your own oponion on what is the advantages and disadvantages between 
two libraries. As we described in previous video, the Crypto++ library is moden OOP designed morden C++ library and 
OpenSSL is more like a classic C library.

Here from crypto++ web site, it described that library include AES algorithm.

AES stands for Advanced Encryption Standard

When using AES, one typically specifies a mode of operation and optionally a padding scheme. 
AES provides confidentiality using most modes of operation such as ECB and CBC
