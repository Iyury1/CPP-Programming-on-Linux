In application, the common usage of RSA public key/private key pair are: signing, verify, encryption and decryption. In this short video, it has demonstrated how to used RSA public key/private key to perform encryption and decryption.
The example used in this video is:
Text Book RSA Key pair Example:  Bob plan to send secret message to Alice;

1) Alice send her public key to bob, and keep private key to herself
2) Bon encrypted message using Alice's public key and send encrypted message to Alice
3) Alice received encrypted message and decrypted hash message using private key
4) after decryption, Alice is able to print/read decrypted message (in text)
