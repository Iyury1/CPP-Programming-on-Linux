C++ Programming on Linux - Boost JSON SAX Style Parser

Boost JSON library is New Libraries added at Version 1.75.0
JSON:
JSON parsing, serialization, and DOM in C++11, from Vinnie Falco and Krystian Stasiowski.
Fast compilation requiring only C++11
Easy and safe modern API with allocator support
Compile without Boost, define BOOST_JSON_STANDALONE
Optional header-only, without linking to a library


BASIC_PARSER
A SAX style parser implementation which converts a serialized JSON into a
series of member function calls to a user provided handler. This allows
custom behaviors to be implemented for representing the document in memory.
