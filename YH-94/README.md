C++ Programming on Linux - Boost JSON SAX Style Parser

Boost JSON library is New Libraries added at Version 1.75.0
JSON:
JSON parsing, serialization, and DOM in C++11, from Vinnie Falco and Krystian Stasiowski.
Fast compilation requiring only C++11
Easy and safe modern API with allocator support
Compile without Boost, define BOOST_JSON_STANDALONE
Optional header-only, without linking to a library

This code is example from my YouTube Chennal C++ Programming on Linux
