The example YH-127 has demonstrated how to generate, load and parse RSA public key and private key.
In this example, it's continue RSA Encryption Schema, how to perform RSA encryptino and Decryption using
Crypto++ Library.

the example will be RSA classic Bon write message to Alice:
* Bob wants to send message to Alice. they decide to use RSA Encryption Schema 
* Bob write message in text file, he use Alice's public key to encrypt the message, and send excrypted file to ALice 
* Alice receive encrypted file, and use her private key to decrypt Bob's File, and read the message.

In privious OpenSSL examples, it demonstrated similar exmple how to perform RSA encryption and decryption using OpenSSL library, you can compare both examples and have your own opinion on
what is advantage and disadvantage between two libraries.
