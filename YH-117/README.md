But OpenSSL is not only be used for network API, but also be used  in many other application, for example VMware, Cloud and Virtual File System application.
OpenSSL BIO : Stands for Basic I/O Abstration.  The advantage of using BIO is, it hides many of the I/O details from an application. and it can  transparently handle  implements cryptographic algorithms into data communication, processing and backup.

The example of this video, using file BIO to read/write data from one file to another, with/without encoding.
