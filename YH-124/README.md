In this example, it's going to demonstrate how to use Crypto++ Modern C++ Library. 
Quick look at Crypto++ Library, it provides almost same features as OpenSSL, What is the major different between Crypto++ and OpenSSL library ?
Compared to OpenSSL, Crypto++ is a modern C++ library of crypto schema (OOP), instead OpenSSL is a classical C library.
When we say, it is modern C++ library, as it supports compilation using C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 runtime libraries
The focus of this example is not to discuss, Crypto++ and OpenSSL, which one is better, we left this topic for you to compare and decide.
Our focus here is how to write a program using Crypto++ C++ Library.
