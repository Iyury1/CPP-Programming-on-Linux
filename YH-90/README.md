Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset of C++.
Xerces-C++ makes it easy to give your application the ability to read and
write XML data.  A shared library is provided for parsing, generating, manipulating,
and validating XML documents. Xerces-C++ is faithful to the XML 1.0 and 1.1 recommendations
and many associated standards.

The parser provides high performance, modularity, and scalability. Source code, samples and API
documentation are provided with the parser. For portability, care has been taken to make minimal
use of templates, no RTTI, and minimal use of #ifdefs.

Independent of the API you want to use, DOM, SAX, or SAX2, your application
must initialize the Xerces system before using the API, and terminate it after
you are done. 

Based on viewer's question, add a new program MyDOMChange.cpp and MyDOMChange.h to demonstrate updaate XML after load and parsed into DOMDocument object.
