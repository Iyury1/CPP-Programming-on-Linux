In this short video, it will discuss one of very common topic in crypto systems,The RSA Cryptography. As we know, RSA is a public key cryptosystem and RSA key is a key pair, private key and public key. 
In previous OpenSSL serious video, we have demonstrated of How to generate RSA key pair using OpenSSL library and OpenSSL API.
In this short video, it will discuss how to generate RSA public and private key pair using Crypto++ Library. You can compare both examples we demonstarted, and have your own opponion of what is advantage and 
disadvantage between 2 libraries.
